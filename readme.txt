Thanks for downloading this game, my first ever project in Python. 
This project was built by following the steps of the 2nd edition of "Python Crash Course" from Eric Matthes.

To get started, install Pygame by running this command in your terminal:
$ python3 -m pip install -- user pygame

If this command does not work on MacOS, try running the command again without the --user flag.
